    ans- I use document.createElement() and append it with appendChild() or append().

3. What is **Event Bubbling** and how does it work?
    ans- Event Bubbling means that when an event happens on a child element, it bubbles up through its parent elements until it reaches the root

  ans- event delegation is a technique where you add an event listener to a parent element, and handle events for its child elements using event.target.

5. What is the difference between **preventDefault() and stopPropagation()** methods?
    ans- event.preventDefault() - Prevents the default browser action.
    event.stopPropagation() - Stops the event from bubbling up
